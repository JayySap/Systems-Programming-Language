#### LLM notes

Asked basic Rust questions like "what does &str mean?", "why do I need &mut?", "how to make a vector?", and "what's the difference between String and &str?". Also got help with simple things like how to use .chars().count() instead of .len() for counting letters, and why some functions need 'static or lifetime stuff.

Learned Rust syntax details, including using zip() and working with complex types like graph: &Vec<Vec<(i32, i32)>>, num_items: &Vec<i32>, and all_paths: &mut Vec<RouteStats>
